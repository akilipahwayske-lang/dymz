## 📝 Note About .html in URLs

**Having .html in URLs is completely normal and professional!**

Examples:
- https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git.html
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML.html
- Many professional sites use .html

**Search engines don't care.** Users don't care. It just works! 🎉

## 🆘 If You Still Have Issues

1. **Clear browser cache:** Ctrl+Shift+Delete (or Cmd+Shift+Delete on Mac)
2. **Try incognito mode**
3. **Check file names are lowercase:** about.html NOT About.html
4. **Verify you uploaded only 7 files**

**THAT'S IT!** Simple, reliable, works every time! 🚀
